# Word Guesser

Very Similar to Hangman game, where we have to predict a word in minimum number of steps.

Built a Decision Tree which breaks down the sample space to half by guessing the letter which has the most frequency at that position. The segregation is based on its presence or absence. This continues untill the expected word only remains.

### How to run?

Run the `word_guesser`  to load the main file `submit.py` and dictionary of words `dict` which will play the game and our algorithm will predict the word.

**Average No. of Trials**: 4-5 Words
